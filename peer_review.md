3. Does the project appear to follow correct coding styles and best practices? Write up one sentence on your findings and give a score 0-3. 3 the code was very easy to understand and read

Are you able to reasonably follow the code without having anyone answer your questions? yes
Are you able to make sense of what the code is doing or is trying to do? Yes
4. Find two pieces of code of any size: one that is readable and easy to follow and one that is difficult to follow and understand. 
easy: I have only positive things to say here. Your code is very easy to read and the class are split up nicely. I think the methods sometimes get a little long and could be refactored into smaller methods but overall very readable.

What makes the readable code readable? Be as detailed as you can in your answer, it can be challenging to explain why something is easy to undertand
What makes the difficult code harder to follow? Be as detailed as you can in your answer. I think all of the code is very well written and easy to understand because the spacing is sync'd and the methods are short and precise. The hard to understand part is more of technical skills thing for me.
