  A discovery app for San Francisco area preschools.  Firebase driven for search and filter
  features to find local preschools, list sorting, google maps, and bookmarking schools.
  Implements Yelp API, SQLite, CursorAdapter, ASync Tasks, RecyclerView, and Collapsing Toolbar.  
  Utilized picasso, google maps play services, retrofit, gson, json, and bottom bar libraries.

  Also includes California state inspection reports, licensing, citations, complaints. Yelp's api
  for school reviews, and linked to actual inspection reports provided publicly by the state of
  California.  The most difficult part of this project was finding the information that parents really
  need to know. I was limited with api’s to use, and California is currently 1 of 12 states that
  doesn’t have licensing, citations or complaints digitized.  I really want this information available
  to other parents, so i decided to use firebase to make it available more quickly.  I can have the
  app in the playstore, and continue to publish new information that will be immediately available
  to the users.
